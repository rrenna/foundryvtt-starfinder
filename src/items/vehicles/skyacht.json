An autopilot&rsquo;s actions are dictated by the GM, and an autopilot can take any of the actions to pilot the vehicle that an actual pilot can. However, autopilots tend to be cautious, rarely risking the integrity of the vehicle and never attempting to ram or run over a target unless specifically programmed as a war machine (indicated in its stat block).<br /><br />The Systems entry in a vehicle&rsquo;s statistics (see page 228) lists the autopilot&rsquo;s modifier to the Piloting skill. For Piloting checks attempted for the Autopilot, apply this modifier first and then apply the vehicle&rsquo;s modifier (listed in the vehicle&rsquo;s Modifiers entry) to the Piloting checks.</span></p>",
