Roll the damage only once and apply it to each creature, rather than rolling separately for each. A vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage and collision DC are listed in the Attack (Collision) entry of its statistics (see Vehicles on page 228).</p>\n<p>When you take a run over action, the vehicle takes damage equal to half the damage rolled for each creature it runs over. If the vehicle becomes unable to proceed due to this damage, it ceases moving. You can still set the vehicle&rsquo;s heading at the end of this movement as normal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A vehicle taking the run over action can damage a creature no more than once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature. The vehicle can run over objects of the appropriate size with the same effects, though they don&rsquo;t receive saving throws unless they are piloted or otherwise animate.</p>",
