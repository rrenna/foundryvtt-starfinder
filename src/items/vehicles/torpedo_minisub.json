If the vehicle becomes unable to proceed due to this damage, it ceases moving. You can still set the vehicle&rsquo;s heading at the end of this movement as normal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A vehicle taking the run over action can damage a creature no more than once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature.
