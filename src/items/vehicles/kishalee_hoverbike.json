        "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListLandVehicles_ctl00_LabelName\">Kishalee hoverbikes are sleek, skinny vehicles that float on cushions of antigrav energy. The driver sits on the front one of two seats and uses a triangular yoke to steer, while the passenger holds on to his own safety bar.<br /><br />Kishalee hoverbikes move by warping the space around themselves, shortening the space directly in front of them and stretching out the space behind them. As a result, they deal very little damage if they ram a target, and jumping off one causes no damage beyond falling damage, because the hoverbike has no effective momentum.<br /><br />This vehicle is a <strong>Relic</strong> and has the following property: These rare items are bits of lost technology or unique items less powerful than artifacts. A relic has an item level but can be sold for 100% of the item&rsquo;s price (like trade goods). A relic cannot be crafted without the means of a specific formula, which is almost always long lost, and often requires specific materials. A relic that became understood well enough to be reproduced, standardized, and mass-marketed might lose its relic status.</span></p>",
