      "value": "<p>Adding a small number of animated quartz crystals to armor for their birefringent effect has become a relatively popular use of the rune-inscribed crystals.</p>\n<p>Animated quartz swarm creators sometimes make this armor upgrade from leftover or defective quartz crystals. A series of hexagonal quartz crystals inscribed with runes are placed at regular intervals over the armor, catching light and making it refract at odd angles due to birefringence. A quartz refractor grants resistance 10 against damage dealt by laser weapons (this doesn&rsquo;t stack with any other resistance that would reduce similar damage, such as fire resistance).</p>",
