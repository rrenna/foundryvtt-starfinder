      "value": "<p>Included in almost every emergency kit scattered around @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}&rsquo;s corridors, oxygen candles are chemical oxygen generators that smolder when ignited. When used in an enclosed space measuring 10 cubic feet, an oxygen candle releases enough oxygen for a single Medium creature to breathe for 10 hours (as opposed to 6 hours) or a Small creature to breathe for 20 hours. The candle provides proportionally more or less oxygen in smaller or larger enclosed spaces respectively. Additional creatures proportionally reduce the time the oxygen lasts. An oxygen candle is consumed upon use.</p>",
