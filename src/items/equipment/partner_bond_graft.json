      "value": "<p>Dragonkin have a long history of allying with humanoids and other species, forming bonds so close the two sometimes seem to think as one. With a small implant in your voice box (or similar organ) controlled by a microscopic chip in your brain (or similar organ), you can form a similar connection. Once this augmentation is installed, you can form a permanent bond with one willing non-dragonkin creature. Once this bond is made, you can&rsquo;t form another partner bond unless your current partner dies. You and your partner can communicate with each other as if you both had telepathy with a range of 100 feet. In addition, if combat begins with you and your partner within 30 feet of each other, both of you roll separate initiative checks but treat the higher result as both of your results.</p>",
