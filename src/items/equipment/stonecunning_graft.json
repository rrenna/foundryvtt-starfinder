Your optical sensors are altered to provide the same benefit. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Perception checks to notice unusual stonework, such as traps and hidden doors located in stone walls or floors. You receive a check to notice such features whenever you pass within 10 feet of them, whether or not you are actively looking.</p>",
