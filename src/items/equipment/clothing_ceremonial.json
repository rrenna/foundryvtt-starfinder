Clothing is often worn both under and over armor, and its benefits apply in nearly all situations. Clothing comes in several varieties based upon its intended purpose, as described below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ceremonial clothes are worn for both religious and nonreligious ceremonies. Religious ceremonial clothing includes vestments worn by priests while performing their ecclesiastical duties and garments for laypeople involved in religious rites. These vestments are usually decorated with colors and embellishments corresponding to a specific faith or religion and are often worn with a religious symbol (see page 131). Nonreligious groups, such as the adata of the @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&rsquo;s Sholar Adat, wear ceremonial clothing for their rituals, with their own unique looks and ornamentations.</strong></p>",
