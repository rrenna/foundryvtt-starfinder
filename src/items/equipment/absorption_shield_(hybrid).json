      "value": "<p>These electrically charged absorption plates can draw the force of an explosion toward you, dampening the effect for everyone else. When you are within the area of an explosion (such as that of a weapon with the explode special property or an area effect that deals damage and allows a Reflex save for half or no damage), you can activate the absorption shield as a reaction. If the explosion deals damage, you take 1-1/2 times as much damage (150%) and canâ€™t attempt a saving throw against the explosion (or use evasion or improved evasion). Other creatures (and objects, if applicable) within the area take only half damage from the explosion (and can attempt to reduce the damage with a saving throw as normal).<br>This upgrade can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.</p>",
