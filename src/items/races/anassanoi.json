However, by @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} standards, anassanoi body language and facial expressions lack animation and emotion, despite the fact that an anassnoi has three eyes and two (vertical) mouths. Anassanois are natural telepaths and extremely open when communicating with telepathy, suffusing such exchanges with the feelings their physical gestures lack. This openness translates into emotional honesty, offering others a ready sense of who the speaking anassanoi is. An anassanoi who wants to avoid this openness can learn to suppress it by becoming practiced in deception, but few anassanois do so.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">A typical anassanoi stands almost 8 feet tall but is slender, weighing around 200 pounds.
