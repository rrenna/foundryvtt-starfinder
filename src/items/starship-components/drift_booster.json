      "value": "<p>A The following Expansion Bay is compatible only with a Supercolossal ship.</p>\n<p>A Drift booster is a rail for launching smaller ships into @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} from within a Supercolossal vesselâ€™s hangar bay. A smaller ship that launches from within the Supercolossal vesselâ€™s hangar bay using @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} booster can temporarily raise its Drift engine rating by 1. This increase lasts only as long as the smaller ship stays in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} and on the same course after launching using @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} booster. If the boosted ship changes course or leaves @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift}, this temporary increase ends.</p>",
